# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple, interactive implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React. The game features a clean user interface, smooth gameplay, and responsive design. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3Ã—3 grid, and it automatically detects the winner or a draw. The application is built using functional components and React hooks for state management.
